# Guess A Number

## This challenge will help you to:
- Implement HTML elements that use specific attributes to perform actions
- Implement CSS styling using `id=`s and `class=`es
- Use Javascript to interact with your web page or the Docuement Object Model (DOM)
- Use HTML or DOM methods to change your webpage

## Summary
Let's create a simple number guessing game. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100 and you will have to guess that number.


## Requirements

1. The user should be able to guess a number until they guess the right number.
2. The user should be able to input a number and click a button to submit the number.
3. The webpage should inform the user to guess a higher number, guess a lower number, or tell the user they guessed the correct number.
4. The webpage should list all guessed numbers the user guessed during the session.

Your number guessing game will consist of an HTML file, CSS file, and a Javascript file.

## HTML File
Your HTML file is already given to you with a `<nav>` element and a `<h1>` tag.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>TITLE</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- Your link to your CSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="">
    <!-- Your Javascript file goes here -->
    <script src="" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- your HTML should go here -->
    <nav>
      <h1>Let's Play the Guessing Number Game!</h1>
    </nav>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, let's add both our `styles.css` and `app.js` files to our `index.html` file:

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="the path to your style.css file">
    <script src="the path to your Javascript file" async defer></script>
```

To open the `index.html` file in the browser by running the following command:

`$ open index.html`

As we add new elements and tags you can refresh your browser and it will reload your Guessing Game app and it will also automatically run your Javascript file and import your CSS styling.

Open up the Chrome Developer Tools and click on the "Console" tab to see the `HELLO JULIET PLATOON!` console log.

Shortcut to open the Chrome Dev Tools: `command + option + i`

## Javascript File

Your CSS file is basically empty at the moment. Once you complete the Javascript portion of the Challenge have fun and start designing a sleak looking Guessing Game app.

Remember, don't worry about styling to begin with.

## Step 1: Create the required HTML Elements
First, create the HTML elements needed to `<input>` a value and a `<button>` to submit your answer.

Each element has specific attributes to it. Research what attributes the `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<form>` elements have.

__Think about how you would execute a Javascript function within an HTML element.__ (maybe Google it)

## Step 2:
